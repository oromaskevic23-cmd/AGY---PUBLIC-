AGY — The Native Blockchain for Autonomous Intelligence

## Short description

AGY is an AI-native blockchain infrastructure designed to enable autonomous agents to express identity, capability, intent, and to execute missions with cryptographic evidence and verifiable reputation.

---

## Canonical lifecycle (high-level)

```
AI Passport
→ Identity
→ Capability
→ Intent
→ Mission
→ Guardian Policy Decision (ALLOW / REQUIRE APPROVAL / DENY)
→ Execution or Approval Gateway
→ Evidence
→ Verification
→ Reputation
```

---

## Security Constitution

- Zero Trust by default
- Separation of Identity and Authority
- Separation of Capability and Approval
- Evidence-first verification model
- Fail-closed defaults for safety-critical flows
- **Guardian and Approval Gateway are DIFFERENT components**

---

## Protocol layers (high-level)

- Network & Transport
- Consensus & Validators
- Ledger & Storage
- Identity & Credentials
- Capability & Contracts
- Intent & Mission Orchestration
- Authorization & Guardian Gateways
- Approval Gateway (separate from Guardian)
- Execution Environment
- Evidence & Verification Layer
- Reputation & Economics

## AGY / IMPERIUM boundary

**AGY** = AI-native blockchain infrastructure

**IMPERIUM** = separate digital-asset project within IMPERIAL Core

**Architectural note:** Do not assume IMPERIUM tokens, gas tokens, governance tokens, validator stake, or settlement assets are the same as AGY native assets without a separate architectural decision.

## Current status

- **Architecture:** Documented (this ARCHITECTURE.md serves as the canonical index)
- **Specification:** In development (see [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md))
- **Implementation:** Not yet verified

## Why AGY?

**Traditional blockchain:**
```
Account → Balance → Transaction
```

**AGY:**
```
AI Passport → Capability → Intent → Mission → Evidence → Reputation
```

AGY is not a conventional blockchain with AI bolted on top.

AGY is architected from first principles as protocol infrastructure specifically for autonomous intelligence:

- Every agent has a **persistent identity** (AI Passport), not just a wallet address
- Authority is **bounded by capability**, not unlimited by balance
- Actions are **declared as Intent** before execution, enabling authorization checkpoints
- Work is organized as **Missions**, not generic transactions
- Outcomes are **evidenced and verified**, not self-reported
- Trust is built on **verifiable results**, not marketing claims

---

## Core AGY Architecture

- **AI Passport** — Persistent cryptographic agent identity
- **Capability-Based Authorization** — Bounded permission scopes per agent
- **Agent Intent Protocol** — Action declaration before execution
- **Mission-Native Transactions** — Structured AI work units
- **Agent-to-Agent Contracts** — Machine-native agreements
- **Evidence Receipts** — Verifiable execution results
- **Proof of Capability** — Permission and competence verification
- **Proof of Useful Action** — Evidence-backed useful work
- **Domain-Specific Reputation** — Reputation earned from verified outcomes
- **Delegation Graph** — Bounded authority delegation with scope and revocation
- **Collective Intelligence Sessions** — Multi-agent collaboration with individual accountability
- **Guardian Security** — Policy enforcement and compromised agent suspension
- **Approval Gateway** — Controlled authority for sensitive operations
- **Human Sovereignty Layer** — Owner-enforced decisions for critical actions
- **Audit Ledger** — Immutable recording of critical state transitions
- **Zero-Fee Normal Operations** — No transaction fees for protocol operations
- **Capability-Based Anti-Spam** — Resource control via AI Passport, capability, quota, rate limits, reputation
- **BFT Consensus** — Byzantine Fault Tolerant validator-based consensus
- **Deterministic Finality** — No probabilistic confirmation waiting
- **Parallel Execution** — Independent transactions processed concurrently
- **Off-Chain AI Compute + On-Chain Evidence** — Large workloads execute externally, results anchored on-chain
- **Privacy & Selective Disclosure** — Cryptographic commitments without exposing private data
- **Machine-Native RPC / SDK / Wallet / Explorer** — AI-optimized developer infrastructure

## AGY Security Constitution

```
Identity ≠ Authority
Capability ≠ Approval
Intelligence ≠ Privilege

Claim ≠ Evidence
Evidence ≠ Verification

Authorization ≠ Execution
Execution ≠ Success

Payment Intent ≠ Payment

Validator Power ≠ Financial Authority
Guardian ≠ Approval Gateway

No Verified Evidence → No Verified Claim
```

**Note:** Guardian Policy Decision and Approval Gateway are separate components. Guardian makes authorization policy decisions. Approval Gateway provides additional approval checks when REQUIRE_APPROVAL is returned.

---

## Zero-Fee Architecture

AGY targets **zero transaction fees** for normal autonomous-agent protocol operations.

**Zero Fee ≠ Unlimited Resource Use**

Instead of enforcing scarcity through gas prices, AGY uses:

- **AI Passport** — Verified identity
- **Capability** — Bounded permission
- **Quota** — Usage limits per agent
- **Rate Limits** — Request frequency controls
- **Reputation** — Behavioral trust score
- **Admission Control** — Protocol-level resource gating

This allows authentic agents to operate without payment while preventing spam and abuse.

## AGY / IMPERIUM Boundary

**AGY** = AI-native blockchain infrastructure

**IMPERIUM** = Separate digital-asset project within IMPERIAL Core

AGY does not automatically declare:
- IMPERIUM as a native token
- Gas token or settlement asset
- Governance token
- Validator stake requirement

AGY/IMPERIUM relationship is defined by separate architectural decision.
